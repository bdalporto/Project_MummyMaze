Mummy Maze Deluxe Game Remake

 We plan on implementing a maze based game very similar to the classic mummy maze game found here: https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/mummy-maze-classic/9wzdncrd35fd.

The game involves a player: the Indiana Jones-like adventurer and an evil mummy that is chasing him. The goal of the player is to reach a doorway leading towards the exit on each level. The player may move one tile at a time, whereas the mummy can move two tiles at a time. The player is at an advantage, as there are various walls scattered across each level, and the mummy is not very smart, running into walls at times if it finds that to be the shortest path. 

The game gets more difficult as the levels progress, including possible additions if the development of the game progresses well over the rest of the quarter. 
Inspired from the original game creators, we could possibly implement the following features to make each level more difficult:

* Different kinds of mummies
* Scorpions
* Keys
* Darker room
* Traps 

Another way to make the game more interesting would be using a seed-method of level generation, creating a random level based on RNG parameters to an input function.

We plan on developing this game in stages:
1. Get the game functionality working, no major graphical components
2. Implement basic graphics
3. Implement features to each level to increase difficulty
4. Implement graphics to make it resemble the original design (or something greater than simple models or shapes).
